An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` is **an ugly number**.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

Constraints:

-   `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

---

```js
var isUgly = function (n) {
    if (n < 1) return false;
    else if (n === 1) return true;

    [2, 3, 5].forEach((prime) => {
        while (!(n % prime)) n = n / prime;
    });

    return n === 1;
};
```
